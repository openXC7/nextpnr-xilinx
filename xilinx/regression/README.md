# xc7 regression cases

One directory per fixed bug. Each design **failed before its patch** and builds after it.

| Case | Guards | Failure before the fix |
|---|---|---|
| `clock-srcc-bufg` | #110 | clock-buffer preplace BFS gave up at 50,000 visited pips; the SRCC-pin-to-BUFG path spans 75,492 wires on xc7a200t, so the clock read as unroutable |
| `bram-sdp-unused-port` | #112 | a width configuration bit was emitted for the unused port of an SDP BRAM and conflicted with the used one, so no bitstream was produced at all |

## Running

```bash
CHIPDB=/path/to/xc7a200t.bin xilinx/regression/run.sh
```

Needs `yosys` and `nextpnr-xilinx` on `PATH`. **No hardware and no prjxray** — the pass
criterion stops at the FASM, which is where all of these bugs bit.

## Why the pass criterion checks content, not just exit status

A case passes when a **non-empty** `.fasm` is produced. Every bug guarded here stopped the
flow outright, so there is no partial-credit case.

The size check is not decoration. A target that exists but is truncated is exactly how a
failing stage reports success — the same defect class as
[openXC7/demo-projects#13](https://github.com/openXC7/demo-projects/pull/13), where a partial
`.frames` yielded a normal-looking 9.7 MB bitstream that flashed, reported `done 1`, and left
the board silent. An existence check whose negative is unobservable carries no information.

## Adding a case

A directory with `top.v` and `top.xdc`, plus a row above naming the patch and the failure.
Keep the I/O minimal: `bram-sdp-unused-port` drives its address and data from internal
counters, so it needs three pins and almost no constraints, which leaves the feature under
test as the only interesting thing in the design.

Constraints use `xc7a200tfbg484-2` pins (ALINX AX7203), resolved from `prjxray-db`
`package_pins.csv`. Another part needs its own `.xdc`.
